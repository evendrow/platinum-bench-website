Onion is a vegetable.\n4. Broccoli is a vegetable.\n5. A yam is often classified as a root vegetable.\n6. Potatoes are also root vegetables.\n\nGiven this classification, we count the items: \n- Garlic (1)\n- Cabbage (1)\n- Onion (1)\n- Broccoli (1)\n- Yam (1)\n- Potatoes (2)\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of vegetables, not the total count including their quantities. Each type of vegetable is counted once, regardless of how many of that type there are. Therefore, potatoes, even though there are two, count as one type of vegetable.\n\nSo, we have:\n- Garlic\n- Cabbage\n- Onion\n- Broccoli\n- Yam\n- Potatoes\n\nCounting each type once, we get a total of 6 different vegetables.\n\nAnswer: 6"
