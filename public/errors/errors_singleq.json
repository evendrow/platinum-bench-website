Let \\( x \\) be the number of marbles Carla started with.\n2. According to the problem, Carla bought 489 marbles.\n3. After buying the marbles, Carla has a total of 2778 marbles.\n\nWe can write the equation as follows:\n\n\\[\nx + 489 = 2778\n\\]\n\n4. To find \\( x \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 489 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = 2778 - 489\n\\]\n\n5. Now, we perform the subtraction:\n\n\\[\nx = 2278\n\\]\n\nThus, Carla started with 2278 marbles.\n\nFinal answer: Answer: 2278"
