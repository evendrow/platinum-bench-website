So, we subtract 15 from 12, which gives us -3. However, in the context of customers, having a negative number doesn't make sense, so we interpret this as the waiter losing all his original customers and still needing 3 more to leave, but since he can't lose more than he has, we just consider he lost all his customers and would have a deficit if it were possible. Essentially, he is left with 0 customers after 12 leave and there's an excess of 3 customers trying to leave who aren't there.\n3. However, the statement that 15 customers left while he got 14 new customers means we need to add the 14 new customers to the scenario after the original customers have left. So, regardless of the initial deficit, he ends up with the 14 new customers.\n\nTherefore, the waiter has 14 customers after the transactions.\n\nAnswer: 14"

If each group has 2 eggs, it cannot also be that she splits them into groups of 11. \n\nLet's clarify: if Rebecca is splitting her eggs into groups of 11, and if there are 2 eggs in each group, it doesn't make sense as it contradicts the grouping.\n\nSo, let's assume she wants to know how many eggs she would have if she has groups of 11, but with 2 eggs per group, we can set it up as follows:\n\n- If she has groups of 11, and each group has 2 eggs, the total number of eggs can be calculated by multiplying the number of groups by the number of eggs per group.\n\nHowever, without knowing the number of groups, we cannot directly calculate the total number of eggs.\n\nInstead, if we interpret the problem such that she has a total number of eggs that can be divided into groups of 11, we can say:\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the total number of eggs.\n\n- If she splits the eggs into groups of 11, the total number of eggs must be \\( 11n \\) where \\( n \\) is the number of groups.\n\nTo satisfy the condition of having 2 eggs per group, we can say:\n\n- If she has \\( n \\) groups, then \\( x = 11n \\) and since she has 2 eggs per group, the total number of eggs would also be \\( 2n \\).\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we need \\( 11n = 2n \\), which cannot happen unless \\( n = 0 \\).\n\nThus, we can conclude that the only way to satisfy the condition of having groups of 11 and 2 eggs per group is to have no eggs.\n\nSo Rebecca has:\n\nAnswer: 0"

This is given as 166.\n\nStep 2: Let 'x' be the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. Then the number of students who suggested bacon is x + 166.\n\nStep 3: The total number of students who suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon is 182 + (x + 166 -182) = x + 166.  We subtract 182 because we are counting the students who suggested mashed potatoes twice.  However, since we are given that the total number of students is 182 + (x + 166 -182), we can simplify it to x + 166.\n\nStep 4: The total number of students is the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested bacon.  Therefore, x + (x + 166) = 182 + (x + 166 - 182) = x + 166. This equation doesn't help us solve for x.\n\nStep 5: Let's use the information that 166 more students suggested bacon than mashed potatoes.  So, the number of students who suggested bacon is the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes plus 166.  Let's represent the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes as 'm'. Then the number of students who suggested bacon is m + 166.\n\nStep 6: The total number of students is 182.  So, m + (m + 166) = 182.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2m + 166 = 182.\n\nStep 8: Subtract 166 from both sides: 2m = 16.\n\nStep 9: Divide both sides by 2: m = 8.\n\nStep 10: The number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is 8.\n\nStep 11: The number of students who suggested bacon is m + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174.\n\nAnswer: 174\n"

      "explanation": "<cot>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about John needing nails for the walls of his house. He uses two types of planks: large and small. The question is asking how many nails he needs in total.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the information given. So, he uses 12 large planks and 10 small planks. Now, the nails required: the large planks together need 15 pieces of nails, and the small planks together need 5 nails. Wait, the wording here is a bit tricky. Let me make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says, \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured.\" Does that mean each large plank requires 15 nails each, or all the large planks together need 15 nails total? Similarly for the small ones: \"small planks together need 5 nails.\" Hmm, the phrasing is important here.\n\nIf it's per plank, then 12 large planks each needing 15 nails would be 12*15. Similarly, 10 small planks each needing 5 nails would be 10*5. Then total nails would be 12*15 + 10*5. Let's compute that: 12*15 is 180, and 10*5 is 50, so total 230. But wait, the problem states \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured.\" The word \"together\" here might mean that all the large planks in total require 15 nails collectively, not each. Similarly for the small ones, \"together need 5 nails.\" So that would be 15 nails for all the large planks and 5 nails for all the small ones. Then total nails would be 15 + 5 = 20. But that seems too low. So there's ambiguity in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"for the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks.\" Then separately, \"If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails.\" The way it's phrased, the \"together\" refers to each group. So all large planks as a group need 15 nails total, and all small planks as a group need 5 nails total. So total nails would be 15 + 5 = 20. But that seems very few nails for 22 planks. Alternatively, maybe each large plank requires 15 nails, and each small plank requires 5. But the problem didn't use \"each\" but \"together.\" Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails.\" The key words are \"together need.\" So that would imply that the total number of nails for all large planks is 15, and for all small planks is 5. So adding them gives 20. But 12 planks with only 15 nails total? That would be 15 nails divided by 12 planks, which is 1.25 nails per plank. That seems odd. Similarly, 10 small planks with 5 nails total would be 0.5 nails per plank. But nails are discrete, so fractions don't make sense. That suggests maybe the problem is not per plank but per group. However, that would lead to fractional nails, which is impossible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the large planks require 15 nails per plank when they are being secured together. Wait, but the wording is \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured.\" The securing process requires 15 nails for all the large planks combined. Similarly for the small ones. So perhaps the answer is 15 + 5 = 20. But that seems low. Let me think of another angle. Maybe the planks are arranged in such a way that each requires a certain number of nails, but the problem states the total for all of each type. For example, if he uses 12 large planks, and all of them together need 15 nails, then per large plank that's 15/12 nails, which is 1.25. But you can't have a fraction of a nail. So that's a problem. Similarly, 5 nails for 10 small planks would be 0.5 per plank. That's impossible. So perhaps the problem is written ambiguously, but maybe \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails each\" or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is mistyped, but the user's original problem is as stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each large plank requires 15 nails, and each small requires 5. Then total nails would be (12 *15) + (10 *5) = 180 +50=230. But then the problem states \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails\", which would be 15 nails for all large planks, which is conflicting. So the problem's wording is ambiguous.\n\nBut since this is a math problem, perhaps we are to interpret it as per group. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nPossibility 1: Total nails for all large planks is 15, total for small is 5. Total nails 20.\n\nPossibility 2: Each large plank requires 15 nails, each small requires 5. Then 12*15 +10*5= 180+50=230.\n\nBut which is correct? The wording is crucial. The problem states: \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails.\" The use of \"together\" suggests that all large planks collectively need 15 nails. Therefore, the total is 15 +5=20.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Let me think of an example. Suppose you have two large planks; together they need 15 nails. Then regardless of how many planks you have, the total nails are fixed. But in the problem, he uses 12 large planks, but the total nails needed for all of them together is 15. That would mean that no matter how many large planks you have, you just need 15 nails? That doesn't make sense. So maybe the problem is mistyped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's per plank. Let's re-examine the problem statement: \"If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails.\" Wait, maybe \"large planks together\" refers to each set of planks. For example, each large plank requires 15 nails, and each small requires 5. But that's not what the wording says. Alternatively, perhaps \"to be secured together\" as in when you attach them, each group (large and small) needs that many nails. But that still leaves the ambiguity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when securing the planks to the wall, each large plank requires a certain number of nails, and the total for all large planks is 15. So 12 large planks in total require 15 nails. So 15 nails divided by 12 planks. But that leads to fractions. Similarly, 10 small planks with 5 nails total. But again, fractions. That's not practical. So perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended numbers are per plank. For example, each large plank requires 15 nails, and each small requires 5. Then total is 12*15 +10*5=180+50=230.\n\nBut the problem says \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured\". If \"together\" is meant to indicate that all large planks as a group require 15 nails total, then that's the total. But the problem is, that would mean that adding more large planks would not increase the number of nails needed, which doesn't make sense in a real-world context. So perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, but given the information as is, the answer is 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that the large planks, when secured (i.e., attached to the wall), require 15 nails per large plank. But the wording says \"large planks together need 15 nails\". So that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps \"to be secured\" refers to the entire structure. For example, the process of securing the large planks (as a group) requires 15 nails, and securing the small planks (as a group) requires 5 nails. So total nails would be 15+5=20.\n\nBut then, why mention the number of planks? If the number of planks (12 large and 10 small) is given, but the total nails required are fixed (15 and 5), then the number of planks is irrelevant. That seems odd. So the problem gives the number of planks but the nails required are fixed regardless of the number of planks. That would mean that even if he used 100 large planks, he still would need 15 nails. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be per plank. So each large plank needs 15 nails, each small needs 5. But the problem says \"large planks together need 15 nails\". So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is stating that for each large plank, when secured, requires 15 nails. Similarly, each small requires 5. But the wording is confusing. Let's see. The problem says: \"If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails.\" The phrase \"together need\" might be a translation issue or a misphrasing. Perhaps it's supposed to mean \"each large plank requires 15 nails, and each small requires 5.\" In that case, total nails would be 12*15 +10*5=230.\n\nBut the problem states \"large planks together need 15 nails.\" If \"together\" implies that all large planks require 15 nails in total, then 15 for large and 5 for small. So 20. But that's not logical with the number of planks given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using \"together\" to mean \"each,\" which is a possible translation error if the problem was originally in another language.\n\nGiven that math problems usually require the numbers to make sense, and since 12 planks with 15 nails each is a lot but possible, and 10 small with 5 each would be 50, totaling 230, that seems plausible. However, given the wording as stated, it's ambiguous. But given that the problem mentions the number of planks, the intended answer is likely 230. Otherwise, why mention 12 and 10 if they aren't factors in the calculation?\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says: \"For the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks. If large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\"\n\nSo, given that he uses 12 large and 10 small planks, and that the large ones require 15 nails collectively, small ones 5 collectively. The total is 20. But that would mean the number of planks is irrelevant, which is odd. But perhaps the problem is designed that way. Maybe the problem is testing whether the test-taker gets misled by the numbers 12 and 10. Because if you don't read carefully and multiply 12*15 and 10*5, you'd get 230, but if you read that the nails are required collectively, then it's 20.\n\nBut which is the correct interpretation? The problem is in English, so let's look at the grammar. The sentence structure is: \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured\". The subject is \"large planks\", verb is \"need\", object is \"15 pieces of nails\". The phrase \"together\" here is an adverb modifying \"need\". So it means that when the large planks are considered together (as a group), they need 15 nails. Similarly, the small planks as a group need 5 nails. Therefore, the total nails are 15+5=20.\n\nBut then why are the counts of planks given? That part is confusing. Maybe the counts are distractors. Or perhaps there's a misinterpretation here. Let's consider another approach. Maybe \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured\" means that each group of large planks requires 15 nails. If there are multiple groups, but the problem states he uses 12 large planks. So perhaps each large plank requires 15 nails, but the problem is phrased as \"large planks together need 15 nails\", which is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the method of securing: when securing the planks together (as in attaching them to each other), they need 15 nails. But that's a different scenario. The problem says \"to be secured\", which could mean securing them to the house wall. So perhaps each large plank requires 15 nails to be secured to the wall, and each small requires 5. In that case, the answer is 12*15 +10*5=230.\n\nBut the problem says \"large planks together need 15 nails\". If \"together\" is meant to imply that all large planks require 15 nails in total, then it's 15. But that would make the number of planks irrelevant, which is unlikely in a math problem. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 230, assuming that the problem meant each large plank needs 15 nails and each small needs 5, despite the wording using \"together\". Otherwise, the problem is either poorly worded or a trick question. Since the user is asking for a solution, I'll go with the more logical interpretation that the numbers are per plank, leading to 230 nails. But I'm not entirely sure due to the ambiguity. However, in typical math problems, when numbers are given (like 12 and 10), they are meant to be used in the calculation. So multiplying by them makes sense. Therefore, the answer is likely 230.\n</cot>\n\nTo determine the total number of nails John needs for the house walls:  \n- **Large planks**: 12 planks \u00d7 15 nails per plank = 180 nails.  \n- **Small planks**: 10 planks \u00d7 5 nails per plank = 50 nails.  \n- **Total nails**: 180 + 50 = **230**.  \n\nAnswer: 230"

      "explanation": "1.  The problem states he needs 22 g *more* wax than colors.\n2.  He needs 57 g of colors.\n3.  Therefore, the total wax needed is 57 g + 22 g = 79 g.\n4.  The problem also states that the feathers require a total of 353 g of wax.\n5. The question asks how much wax does he already have.\n6. So, we have the equation: 79g + wax_already_have = 353g\n7. Subtracting 79g from both sides, we get: wax_already_have = 353g - 79g\n8. wax_already_have = 274g\n\nAnswer: 274\n"

      "explanation": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Collection**:  \n   Marco and his dad initially collected strawberries that weighed **22 pounds** together.\n\n2. **Additional Strawberries Found**:  \n   On the way back, Marco's dad found **30 more pounds** of strawberries. This means the total weight of strawberries increased by 30 pounds.\n\n3. **Marco's Strawberries Now**:  \n   After finding the additional strawberries, Marco's strawberries now weigh **36 pounds**.\n\n4. **Determine Marco's Initial Strawberries**:  \n   Let the weight of Marco's strawberries initially be $ M $.  \n   Since the total initial weight was 22 pounds, the weight of his dad's strawberries initially was $ 22 - M $.\n\n5. **Marco's Strawberries After the Addition**:  \n   Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds. This means Marco did not pick up any of the 30 additional pounds found by his dad. Therefore, Marco's strawberries remained the same as his initial collection:  \n   $$\n   M = 36 \\, \\text{pounds}.\n   $$\n\n6. **Dad's Strawberries Now**:  \n   The dad initially had $ 22 - M $ pounds of strawberries. Substituting $ M = 36 $, we find:  \n   $$\n   \\text{Dad's initial strawberries} = 22 - 36 = -14 \\, \\text{pounds}.\n   $$"

      "explanation": "Let's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the problem**:  \n   Dan has $2, but he buys candy bars that cost $3 each. The problem states that each candy bar costs $6, but this seems inconsistent. We will assume the correct cost of each candy bar is $3, as the problem mentions \"each one costing $3.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the situation**:  \n   Dan has $2, but each candy bar costs $3. This means Dan does not have enough money to buy even one candy bar, as $2 is less than $3.\n\n3. **Calculate how many candy bars Dan can buy**:  \n   To determine how many candy bars Dan can buy, divide the total money Dan has ($2) by the cost of one candy bar ($3):  \n   $$\n   \\text{Number of candy bars} = \\frac{\\text{Total money Dan has}}{\\text{Cost of one candy bar}} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n   $$  \n   Since Dan cannot buy a fraction of a candy bar, the result is 0.\n\n4. **Final answer**:  \n   Dan cannot buy any candy bars because he does not have enough money.\n\nAnswer: 0"
