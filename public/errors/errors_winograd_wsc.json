      "prediction": "b",
      "explanation": "To determine what \"he\" refers to in the phrase \"he is so short,\" let's analyze the sentence step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the context**: The phrase discusses a situation where John's view of the stage is obstructed by Billy, who is positioned in front of him. The reason for this obstruction is related to someone's height.\n\n2. **Identifying the pronoun's antecedent**: The pronoun \"he\" in \"he is so short\" needs to refer back to a male subject in the sentence. The two possible antecedents are \"John\" and \"Billy.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing the logic**: If Billy being in front of John obstructs John's view because \"he is so short,\" it implies that the person's shortness is the reason for the obstruction. If John were the one who is short, it wouldn't logically explain why Billy being in front of him would block his view. The obstruction is because Billy, being the one in front, is short and thus does not block a significant portion of John's view, or the sentence implies that Billy's position in front of John is what matters, and the height issue is actually a characteristic of Billy that is relevant to the obstruction. However, the logical interpretation leans towards understanding that the obstruction is due to Billy's presence and his height relative to John, but the sentence's structure suggests the height is the reason for the obstruction, which leads to confusion.\n\n4. **Correct interpretation based on sentence structure**: Despite the logical confusion, the sentence implies the obstruction is because of Billy's presence and the height issue seems to be a reason for the obstruction. However, the correct interpretation based on standard English sentence structure is that \"he\" refers to the subject closest to the pronoun or the one that logically fits the description given by the sentence's predicate. In this case, the sentence suggests that the reason John can't see is because of Billy's position and the height issue seems to be a characteristic of the person causing the obstruction, which the sentence implies to be Billy due to the structure.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the sentence's structure and the logical analysis, the pronoun \"he\" refers to Billy, as the obstruction and the reason (height) are characteristics or actions associated with him in this context.\n\nAnswer: B"

      "explanation": "To determine what \"he\" refers to in the phrase \"after he reached the bottom of the stairs,\" let's analyze the sentence structure and context.\n\nThe sentence is: \"Tom threw his schoolbag down to Ray after he reached the bottom of the stairs.\"\n\n1. The main action is Tom throwing his schoolbag down to Ray.\n2. The phrase \"after he reached the bottom of the stairs\" indicates an action that happened before the main action (Tom throwing his schoolbag).\n\nGiven the context, for Tom to throw his schoolbag down to Ray, it makes more sense that Tom is the one who has reached the bottom of the stairs because the action of throwing the schoolbag \"down\" suggests a movement from a higher position to a lower one. However, the phrase specifically says \"after he reached the bottom of the stairs,\" which indicates the action of reaching the bottom of the stairs happened before the throwing action.\n\nConsidering the logic of the sentence, if Tom threw the schoolbag down to Ray after reaching the bottom of the stairs, it would imply that the act of reaching the bottom of the stairs is a prerequisite for the action of throwing. However, the description implies a sequence where reaching the bottom of the stairs enables or precedes the throwing action in a way that suggests Tom is the subject of both actions.\n\nHowever, analyzing it strictly from a grammatical standpoint without overcomplicating the logic of the sequence of actions, the pronoun \"he\" in the sentence would logically refer to the subject of the sentence, which is Tom, because the sentence structure suggests a continuation of action related to the main subject (Tom) rather than abruptly switching to Ray without clear indication.\n\nTherefore, considering the grammatical structure and the logical flow of actions described, \"he\" refers to Tom.\n\nAnswer: A"

The phrase mentions that the sack of potatoes had been placed below the bag of flour, establishing a spatial relationship between the two objects.\n3. The clause \"so it had to be moved first\" implies that because of the spatial relationship (the sack being below the bag), something needs to be moved before the other can be accessed or moved.\n4. Given the sack of potatoes is below the bag of flour, logically, the sack of potatoes would need to be moved first if one were trying to access or move the bag of flour.\n\nTherefore, considering the spatial arrangement and the logical sequence of actions implied, \"it\" refers to the sack of potatoes, which needs to be moved first to access the bag of flour.\n\nAnswer: A"

      "explanation": "To determine what \"it\" refers to in the phrase \"it was too cautious,\" let's analyze the context and the subjects involved.\n\n1. The phrase mentions two main subjects: the cat and the mouse.\n2. The cat is described as lying by the mouse hole, which implies the cat is waiting for an opportunity to catch the mouse.\n3. The phrase then states \"but it was too cautious.\" Given the context of one animal waiting to catch another, caution would be a characteristic that prevents the action of catching or being caught.\n\nConsidering the roles of the cat (the predator) and the mouse (the prey), caution would more likely be attributed to the mouse in this scenario, as being cautious would be a survival strategy for the mouse to avoid being caught. However, the sentence structure and the use of \"but\" suggests a contrast to the preceding action (the cat waiting to catch the mouse), implying that the caution is actually what's preventing the cat from catching the mouse. Therefore, the caution is more logically attributed to the cat, as it's the one that needs to take action to catch the mouse but is being held back by its caution.\n\nSo, \"it\" refers to the cat, as the cat's caution is what's preventing the action of catching the mouse from happening.\n\nAnswer: A"

If the chair were broken, it would not necessarily prevent Sam from playing the piano, as he could still stand, which he ends up doing anyway. However, if the piano were broken, it would directly prevent Sam from playing, which aligns with the sequence of events and the decision to stand instead.\n\n3. **Logical Outcome**: The outcome of \"it was broken\" is that Sam \"had to stand instead.\" Standing instead of sitting could be a response to either the chair or the piano being broken, but given the primary intention was to play the piano, the critical factor would be the piano's functionality.\n\nConsidering these points, the logical conclusion is that \"it\" refers to the piano, as the piano being broken directly impacts Sam's ability to play, which is the implied intention of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: B"

Given that newspapers are typically made of paper and are susceptible to getting wet and damaged in the rain, it makes sense that the action is taken to protect the newspaper.\n   - **Option B: The backpack**: While backpacks can also get wet, the specific action described (carrying the newspaper over the backpack) doesn't directly imply an effort to keep the backpack dry. Instead, the backpack seems to be used as a means to protect the newspaper.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical interpretation is that \"it\" refers to the newspaper, as the action described is aimed at protecting the newspaper from getting wet in the rain.\n\nAnswer: A"

Generally, when a pronoun is used in a following clause like this, it tends to refer to the subject of the previous clause (the lawyer in this case) unless there's a clear reason to believe otherwise.\n\n5. However, we need to consider the context and logic of the situation:\n   - It's more likely that a witness would be reluctant to repeat something in a legal setting.\n   - The lawyer, being the one asking the question, would typically have no reason to be reluctant to repeat it.\n\n6. The reluctance to repeat something fits better with the witness's role in this scenario.\n\n7.

The phrase describes a summer afternoon, which suggests warm weather.\n2. The dog was initially sitting in the middle of the lawn.\n3. The dog then moved to a spot under the tree.\n4. The reason given for the dog's movement is \"because it was hot.\"\n\nGiven this context, we need to identify what \"it\" refers to. The options are:\n\n- Option A: The dog\n- Option B: The spot under the tree\n\nThe phrase \"it was hot\" is explaining the reason for the dog's action. The dog moved to a cooler spot under the tree because the general environment or weather was hot, not because the dog itself was hot. The word \"it\" in this context typically refers to the weather or the environment, which is not explicitly listed as an option here. However, given the options, the closest fit is the general condition of the environment, which would align with the notion of the weather being hot.\n\nTherefore, neither Option A (The dog) nor Option B (The spot under the tree) directly describes what \"it\" refers to. However, based on common usage, \"it was hot\" usually refers to the weather or ambient temperature, not the dog or the specific spot.\n\nSince the options do not perfectly match, the most logical conclusion is that \"it\" refers to the general environment, which is not explicitly listed. However, if forced to choose between the given options, neither accurately captures the intended meaning.\n\nIn conclusion, the phrase \"it was hot\" refers to the general environmental condition, which is not directly represented by either option. Therefore, a more accurate representation of the intended meaning is not provided by the options.\n\nAnswer: None of the options accurately describe what \"it\" refers to."

The phrase starts with \"Jane knocked on the door, and Susan answered it.\" This establishes two main characters: Jane and Susan. Jane is the one performing the action of knocking, and Susan is the one responding to that action by answering the door.\n\n2. The next part of the phrase is \"She invited her to come out.\" Here, \"She\" is a pronoun that needs to be linked back to one of the characters mentioned. Since pronouns typically refer back to the most recently mentioned noun or character, we need to consider the context.\n\n3. In the sentence \"Jane knocked on the door, and Susan answered it,\" Susan is the last character mentioned before the pronoun \"She\" is used. Therefore, following the typical pattern of pronoun usage, \"She\" would refer to the last mentioned character, which is Susan.\n\n4. Additionally, the logic of the situation supports this interpretation. Susan, having answered the door, is in a position to invite someone to come out. Jane, on the other hand, is the one who has come to the door, so it would not make sense for Jane to be inviting herself out.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pronoun \"She\" in \"She invited her to come out\" refers to Susan.\n\nAnswer: B."

The use of \"she\" in \"she had studied so hard\" is referring to the person who studied hard in relation to the context of the sentence.\n\nGiven that Anna is the one who is being compared to Lucy and is the subject of the sentence, it is logical to conclude that \"she\" refers to Anna.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: A"

The phrase states that \"Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems.\" This indicates that Susan has information about Ann's private matters.\n\n2. The use of the term \"indiscreet\" suggests a lack of discretion or the tendency to reveal private information. \n\n3.

Since the lawyer is the one who asked the question, it would not make sense for the lawyer to be reluctant to repeat something he himself has just asked. The reluctance logically aligns with the witness, who might be hesitant to answer or repeat a question due to its nature or implications.\n4. **Consider the pronoun's antecedent**: In English, a pronoun typically refers back to the most recent noun it can logically replace. However, logical consistency and context are crucial. Here, \"he\" logically refers to the witness because the witness is the one being asked to respond or repeat the question, making it more plausible for the witness to be reluctant.\n\nBased on these steps, \"he\" in \"he was reluctant\" refers to the witness, as it is more contextually appropriate for the witness to be hesitant about repeating a question asked by the lawyer.\n\nAnswer: B"

The condition is \"he reached the bottom of the stairs.\"\n\n3. **Determining the Subject of \"he\"**: The subject \"he\" refers to the person who reached the bottom of the stairs. Given the context, it's logical to infer that the person reaching the bottom of the stairs is the same person who is in a position to throw the schoolbag down. Since Tom is the one throwing the schoolbag, it implies that Tom is the one who has moved to a position (reached the bottom of the stairs) from where he can perform the action of throwing the schoolbag down to Ray.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the action sequence and the logic of who is in a position to throw the schoolbag down after reaching a certain location (the bottom of the stairs), \"he\" refers to Tom.\n\nAnswer: A"

The phrase is comparing Anna's performance to Lucy's on a test, stating that Anna did a lot worse than Lucy. The reason given for Anna's poor performance is that \"she had studied so hard.\" The implication here is somewhat counterintuitive because one might expect studying hard to lead to better results, not worse. However, the sentence structure suggests that the subject of the sentence \"she\" is the one whose actions (studying hard) are being directly linked to the outcome (doing worse on the test).\n\nGiven that the sentence begins with \"Anna did a lot worse than her good friend Lucy,\" Anna is the primary subject of the comparison being made. The phrase \"because she had studied so hard\" is providing a reason for Anna's poor performance relative to Lucy's. If \"she\" referred to Lucy, the sentence would be implying that Lucy's hard studying was the reason for Anna's worse performance, which doesn't logically follow.\n\nTherefore, the most logical interpretation is that \"she\" refers to Anna, as the sentence is discussing Anna's performance and the reason for it.\n\nAnswer: A"

The phrase states, \"The sack of potatoes had been placed below the bag of flour, so it had to be moved first.\" The key to understanding what \"it\" refers to lies in the relationship between the sack of potatoes and the bag of flour as described.\n\n1. **Placement**: The sack of potatoes is placed below the bag of flour. This implies a physical stacking order where the potatoes are at the bottom and the flour is on top.\n2. **Logical Movement**: When moving items that are stacked, the item at the bottom must be moved before the one on top to avoid obstruction or spilling the contents of the items.\n3. **Contextual Clue**: The phrase \"so it had to be moved first\" is a consequence of the placement described. Given the stacking order, moving the sack of potatoes first is a necessity to access or move the bag of flour safely.\n\nBased on these considerations, \"it\" logically refers to the item that needs to be moved to allow access to the other item. Since the sack of potatoes is below the bag of flour and must be moved to access the flour, \"it\" refers to the sack of potatoes.\n\nAnswer: A"

However, in more complex sentences or when clarity is needed, the pronoun's antecedent (the noun it refers to) can depend on the context and the relationship between the clauses.\n\nGiven the structure \"Pete envies Martin although he is very successful,\" the dependent clause \"although he is very successful\" is more logically connected to Martin because the sentence implies a reason or an ironic situation regarding Pete's envy. If \"he\" referred to Pete, the sentence would suggest that Pete envies Martin despite Pete's own success, which doesn't provide a clear reason for the envy based on the information given. On the other hand, if \"he\" refers to Martin, it implies that Pete envies Martin even though Martin is successful, which could suggest that Martin's success is a reason for Pete's envy or that Pete's envy is not based on a lack of success on Martin's part.\n\nTherefore, considering the logical flow and the typical use of pronouns in English sentences, \"he\" is more likely referring to Martin, as it provides a clearer reason for Pete's envy and creates a more coherent narrative about their relationship and the reason for Pete's feelings.\n\nAnswer: B"

The subject of the sentence is \"I,\" and the actions are \"used\" and \"put.\"\n2. The objects involved are \"an old rag\" and \"the knife.\"\n3. The action \"used an old rag to clean the knife\" indicates that the rag was the tool used for cleaning, and the knife was the object being cleaned.\n4. When it comes to \"and then I put it in the trash,\" we need to consider which object (\"the rag\" or \"the knife\") is more likely to be disposed of after being used for cleaning.\n5. Given that the rag is described as \"old\" and was used for cleaning, which might make it dirty or unfit for further use, it's reasonable to infer that the rag would be the item thrown away.\n6. However, the pronoun \"it\" is used to refer to the object that was the focus of the action immediately before. In this case, \"I used an old rag to clean the knife\" implies that the primary focus is on the action involving the knife, but since the rag was used for the cleaning, the subsequent action of disposing of \"it\" logically refers back to the object that was directly involved in the action described before the \"and then\" clause.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most direct antecedent for \"it\" based on the sentence structure would be \"the knife,\" as the sentence structure implies a sequence of actions where the focus shifts from the action of cleaning to the disposal of the object that was cleaned. However, the logical inference based on typical behavior (cleaning and then disposing of the cleaning tool) suggests the rag.

The phrase starts with \"Adam can't leave work here until Bob arrives to replace him.\" This sets up the situation where Adam is waiting for Bob to arrive so that Adam can leave work.\n2. The second part of the phrase is \"If Bob had left home for work on time, he would be gone by this time.\" The conditional statement \"If Bob had left home for work on time\" directly refers to Bob's actions and their consequences.\n3. The pronoun \"he\" in \"he would be gone\" logically refers back to the subject of the conditional statement, which is Bob. The statement is discussing the hypothetical scenario where Bob leaves on time and the consequence of that action, which is that he (Bob) would have already arrived (and thus be \"gone\" from his starting point, i.e., home) by the current time.\n\nGiven this analysis, \"he\" refers to Bob, as the sentence is discussing the consequences of Bob's actions (leaving home for work on time) on his current state (being gone from home, implying he would have arrived at work).\n\nAnswer: B"

Sam pulls up a chair to the piano, indicating his intention to sit down, presumably to play the piano.\n\n2. **Sentence Structure**: The phrase \"but it was broken\" is a dependent clause that provides a reason for why Sam had to stand instead of sitting. The pronoun \"it\" is used to refer back to a noun in the sentence.\n\n3. **Referent Identification**: The critical part is identifying what \"it\" refers to. If \"it\" referred to the chair, the sentence would imply that the chair being broken is the reason Sam had to stand. However, the action of pulling up a chair suggests that the chair is functional enough to be moved into position. On the other hand, if \"it\" refers to the piano, the implication is that the piano's broken state prevents Sam from using it (playing it), which could indirectly suggest he had to stand because he couldn't play, but more logically, it suggests the piano's condition is the focus.\n\n4. **Logical Conclusion**: Given the context and the structure, \"it\" is more logically referring to the piano. The reason Sam had to stand instead of sitting doesn't directly correlate with the chair's condition (since he was able to pull it up), but rather with the piano's condition. If the piano is broken, it makes sense that Sam wouldn't sit down to play it, as there would be no point.\n\nAnswer: B"

In this sentence, \"them\" could potentially refer to either \"copies of the newsletter\" or \"chairs,\" as both are plural nouns.\n\n3. **Analyze the logical flow**: The hope was to place copies of the newsletter on all the chairs.

      "explanation": "To determine what \"it\" refers to in the phrase \"it got full of ink,\" let's analyze the sentence step by step:\n\n1. The subject of the sentence is the person who couldn't find a spoon and decided to use a pen to stir their coffee.\n2. The action involves using a pen (which is not the typical utensil for stirring coffee) for stirring.\n3. The consequence of this action is that \"it got full of ink.\"\n\nGiven the context, \"it\" must refer to the object that was used to stir the coffee and as a result of this action became filled with ink. Since the pen is the object being used in an unconventional manner (stirring coffee), and pens contain ink, the logical conclusion is that \"it\" refers to the pen.\n\nThe coffee could potentially get contaminated with ink, but the phrase \"got full of ink\" more directly implies that the object itself became filled with ink, which is more likely to happen to the pen (as it's the source of the ink) than the coffee.\n\nTherefore, \"it\" refers to the pen.\n\nAnswer: A"

The phrasing \"Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better\" implies the improvement is related to the drawing being placed *above*.\n\n6. **Evaluate the phrase \"with another one above it\":** This phrase reinforces that the improvement in appearance is due to the presence of something *above* the \"it.\"  Since Sam's drawing is the one with something above it (Tina's drawing), this strongly suggests \"it\" refers to Sam's drawing.\n\n7. **Formulate the answer:** Based on the analysis, Option A is the correct answer.\n\n8. **Format the answer:**  Present the answer in the requested format: \"Answer: A\".Answer: A"

We need to figure out which of the two named individuals, Susan or Ann, is being described as indiscreet.\n\n4. **Consider the causal relationship:** The word \"because\" indicates a cause-and-effect relationship. The reason Susan knows about Ann's problems is *because* of the quality described in the second clause.\n\n5. **Evaluate Option A (Susan):** If \"she\" refers to Susan, the sentence means Susan knows Ann's problems *because Susan* is indiscreet. This makes logical sense. Susan's indiscretion would explain how she came to know private information.\n\n6. **Evaluate Option B (Ann):** If \"she\" refers to Ann, the sentence means Susan knows Ann's problems *because Ann* is indiscreet. This is less likely. Ann's indiscretion might explain why her problems are known *generally*, but it doesn't directly explain *why Susan* knows them specifically. While Ann being indiscreet could *lead* to Susan knowing, the sentence structure strongly suggests the indiscretion is the reason *Susan* has the knowledge.\n\n7. **Confirm the most logical interpretation:**  The most logical and grammatically sound interpretation is that Susan's indiscretion is the reason she knows Ann's problems.\n\n8. **Formulate the answer:** Based on the analysis, \"she\" refers to Susan.

This makes sense in the context of the pillar being an obstruction.\n    * **Option B (The stage):** If \"it\" refers to the stage, the sentence means \"I can't see the stage\". This also makes sense given the pillar is between the speaker and the stage.\n\n5. **Determine the most likely referent:** While both interpretations are grammatically possible, the *reason* for not seeing something is the pillar's presence. The inability to see the stage is a *consequence* of the pillar being in the way.

Given the previous sentence, \"him\" would likely refer to Fred. This interpretation makes sense: Steve is following Fred's example, and Steve is influencing Fred.\n\n7. **Test Option B (Fred):** If \"He\" refers to Fred, the sentence means \"Fred influences him hugely.\" Who is \"him\"?

This interpretation also makes sense: Fred's example is being followed, and Fred is influencing Steve.\n\n8. **Consider the connection between the sentences:** The first sentence establishes Steve as the follower. The second sentence describes an influence. It's more logical that the person *doing* the following is also the one *exerting* the influence, especially since it's stated \"in everything.\"  While Fred's example influences Steve, the sentence structure suggests a more direct influence from the subject of the second sentence.\n\n9. **Re-evaluate based on flow and meaning:**  The phrase implies a dynamic where Steve is actively taking Fred's lead and, in doing so, is having a significant impact *on* Fred. This aligns better with Steve being the subject of the influence.\n\n10. **Confirm with standard pronoun reference:** In most cases, a pronoun refers back to the subject of the preceding clause or sentence when there are two nouns present. While both interpretations are grammatically possible, the most natural and common reading is that \"He\" refers to Steve.\n\n11. **Formulate the answer:** Based on the analysis, Option A is the most likely and logical answer.

      "explanation": "1. **Analyze the question:** The question asks for the referent of \"it\" in the specific clause \"it is too narrow.\"\n\n2. **Examine the clause:** \"it is too narrow.\"  The word \"narrow\" describes a physical dimension.\n\n3. **Consider the context:** The preceding clause states \"The table won't fit through the doorway.\" This implies a size mismatch between the table and the doorway.\n\n4. **Evaluate Option A (The table):** If the table is too narrow, it *could* be a reason it won't fit through the doorway (perhaps it's too long or tall, but also too narrow to maneuver). However, \"narrow\" typically refers to the smaller dimension. If something is too narrow to fit *through* something else, it's usually the object trying to pass through that is too wide, not too narrow.\n\n5. **Evaluate Option B (The doorway):** If the doorway is too narrow, that directly explains why the table won't fit through it. The table's width is greater than the doorway's width.\n\n6. **Re-read the sentence with each option substituted:**\n    * \"The table won't fit through the doorway because *the table* is too narrow.\" This sounds slightly odd in the context of fitting *through* something. While a table *could* be too narrow in some unusual context (like trying to balance it on a thin ledge), in the context of a doorway, \"too narrow\" usually refers to the opening.\n    * \"The table won't fit through the doorway because *the doorway* is too narrow.\" This makes perfect sense. The doorway's narrowness prevents the table from passing through.\n\n7. **Consider common usage:**  When something doesn't fit through an opening because of size, the opening is usually described as \"too narrow.\"\n\n8. **Conclusion:** Option B makes more logical sense in the context of the given sentence. However, rereading the prompt, the sentence *actually* says \"it is too narrow\", not \"it is too wide\". This changes the interpretation.\n\n9. **Re-evaluate with the correct wording:**  If \"it\" refers to the table and the table is too narrow, it *could* mean it's too thin to be stable or for some other reason related to its narrowness. However, in the context of fitting through a doorway, the most likely intended meaning is that the table's *width* (or some other dimension) is too large for the doorway's width.\n\n10. **Final Decision:**  Despite the slightly awkward phrasing, the most logical interpretation based on the sentence structure is that \"it\" refers back to the subject of the main clause, which is \"The table\". The reason it won't fit is because one of its dimensions (likely width, though not explicitly stated) is too small for the doorway's corresponding dimension. The sentence is a bit clumsy, as \"too wide\" would be more typical, but given the wording, the table is the referent.\n\n11. **Format the answer:**  Answer: AAnswer: A"

      "explanation": "To determine what \"it\" refers to in the phrase \"it was broken,\" we need to analyze the context and the sequence of actions described in the sentence.\n\n1. Sam pulled up a chair to the piano.\n2. It was broken.\n3. Sam had to stand instead.\n\nThe sequence of actions suggests that Sam initially intended to sit down at the piano. However, something was broken, which prevented him from sitting. Since the chair is the object that Sam would use to sit, it is logical to consider whether the chair was broken. However, the phrase \"had to stand instead\" implies that the object preventing Sam from sitting was the piano itself, not the chair. If the chair were broken, Sam could still sit on another chair or find a different seat. The fact that he had to stand suggests that the piano was the broken object, making it impossible for him to sit and play.\n\nTherefore, \"it\" in \"it was broken\" refers to the piano.\n\nAnswer: B"

The phrase mentions using a pen to stir coffee because a spoon couldn't be found.\n2. The sentence then states that using the pen was a bad idea.\n3. The reason it was a bad idea is explained: \"it got full of ink.\"\n\nGiven the context, \"it\" must refer to the object that was used to stir the coffee and that could logically contain ink. The only object mentioned that fits this description is the pen. The coffee cannot logically \"get full of ink\" in this context.\n\nTherefore, \"it\" refers to the pen.\n\nAnswer: A"
